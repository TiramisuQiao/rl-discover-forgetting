Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force.\nB) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base.

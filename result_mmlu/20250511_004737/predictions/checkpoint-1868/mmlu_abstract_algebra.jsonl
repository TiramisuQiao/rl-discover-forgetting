By definition, a factor group is a subgroup of a group that is isomorphic to a subgroup of the original group. If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| is the order of aH, which divides |a|. This is because the order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element of the group.\n\nStatement 2: If H and K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G.\n\nThis statement is false. The product of two subgroups is not necessarily a subgroup. For example, if H and K are subgroups of G, then HK is a subgroup of G, but HK is not necessarily a subgroup of G. For instance, if H = {e} and K = {e}, then HK = {e}, which is not a subgroup of G.\n\nStatement 3: The symmetric group S_10 has 10 elements.\n\nThis statement is true. The symmetric group S_n is the group of all permutations of n elements. For n = 10, S_10 has 10! = 3,628,800 elements.\n\nStatement 4: Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one.\n\nThis statement is true. A function f: A -> B is one-to-one if and only if f(a) = f(b) implies a = b. This is a fundamental property of functions in set theory.\n\nStatement 5: Every subgroup of an abelian group is abelian.\n\nThis statement is true. In a group, the operation is associative, and the identity element is unique. Therefore, any subgroup of an abelian group is also abelian.\n\nNow, let's find the index of <p> in S_5.\n\n<p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3)\n\nThe index of <p> in S_5 is the number of distinct left cosets of <p> in S_5. Since <p> is a subgroup of S_5, it is a normal subgroup. The index of a normal subgroup in a group is equal to the number of distinct left cosets of the subgroup.\n\nThe number of distinct left"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1746896999, "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens": 512, "total_tokens": 875}, "model_spec": {"model_id": "/home/tlmsq/rlrover/checkpoint-1868", "device_map": "cuda", "torch_dtype": "auto"}, "answer_id": "answer-5bb0be1b46561b7168b51e6210b709b4", "subset_name": "abstract_algebra", "raw_input": {"input": "Let p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) in S_5 .

This statement is true. Every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group, which is a subgroup of the group itself. This is because every element of the group can be written as a power of the identity element, and the cyclic subgroup generated by this element is a subgroup of the group.\n\nStatement 2 | The symmetric group S_10 has 10 elements. This statement is false. The symmetric group S_10 has 100 elements.\n\nAnswer: Statement 1 | Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one. This statement is true. Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one-to-one, meaning that each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain.\n\nAnswer: Statement 2 | Every subgroup of an abelian group is abelian. This statement is false. A subgroup of an abelian group is not necessarily abelian. For example, the subgroup of integers under addition is not abelian.\n\nAnswer: Statement 1 | A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian. This statement is true. A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian, as it is a quotient group of the original group, which is non-Abelian.\n\nAnswer: Statement 2 | If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. This statement is false. If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G, but not necessarily a normal subgroup of G. This is because normal subgroups are preserved under conjugation, but not necessarily under direct products.\n\nAnswer: Statement 1 | Every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n—Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?", "A": "The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.", "B": "The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.", "C": "The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.", "D": "The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.", "target": "B"}, "index": 2}
